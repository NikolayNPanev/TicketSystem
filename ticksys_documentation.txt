TICKETING SYSTEM

DEPENDENCIES:
shc (for compilation)
make (for compilation)

Compilation and Installation:
	In order to compile this project, you would need the followin
	On level package/ run the following commands:
	$ make
	$ make install

	!!WARNING!!
	The command "$ make install" will require super user privilages, because it copies the binaries inside the /home/usr/bin folder.
	If you lack user privilages, I suggest you make an alias inside your shell rc file in you home directory (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc etc)
	In this alias you can link the binary compiled inside package/bin/
